# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 23rd, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I fixed my edge detection algorithm for *edge* cases (heh).

**Thoughts** Took me like 30 mins to even get back into the project. I think it could use quite a cleanup and the edge detection could be made easier to read.

### Day 2: January 24th, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Refactored edge detection and accidentally fixed a bug at the edges (uh, tips?) of the edge detection.

**Thoughts** Was gonna improve the API by packing everything into a nice class, but hey, fixed the detection instead and cleaned up code.

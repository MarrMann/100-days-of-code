# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 23rd, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I fixed my edge detection algorithm for *edge* cases (heh).

**Thoughts** Took me like 30 mins to even get back into the project. I think it could use quite a cleanup and the edge detection could be made easier to read.

### Day 2: January 24th, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Refactored edge detection and accidentally fixed a bug at the edges (uh, tips?) of the edge detection.

**Thoughts** Was gonna improve the API by packing everything into a nice class, but hey, fixed the detection instead and cleaned up code.

No links!


### Day 3: January 25th, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Refactored most mesh analysis stuff into MeshAnalyserUtils and almost finished work on a more effeicient MeshAnalyser (1 loop > 2 loops). Also accidentally introduced a bug.

**Thoughts** I gotta get this done earlier in the day, doing it just before 24 kills me. Set a timer, mute *everything*. Friends and family can wait 1 hour.

### Day 4: January 26th, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Finished refactoring and fixed existing bugs. Slowly started work on hole detection

**Thoughts** Muting everything worked, but I feel super fucking stressed with everything I have to do every day already. Let's see tomorrow...

### Day 5: January 27th, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I'm a grade a retard today and couldn't figure out how to detect holes, no progress.

**Thoughts** I hate banging my head against a wall, hope today will be better.

**Link(s) to work**
No.


### Day 6: January 28th, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Got over my retardation and figured out a super smooth way to figure out if something is a hole. Made an Edge entity class

**Thoughts** Finding the simplest solution is often a good thing, it just takes a bit of time.

**Link(s) to work**
No.

# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 23rd, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I fixed my edge detection algorithm for *edge* cases (heh).

**Thoughts** Took me like 30 mins to even get back into the project. I think it could use quite a cleanup and the edge detection could be made easier to read.

### Day 2: January 24th, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Refactored edge detection and accidentally fixed a bug at the edges (uh, tips?) of the edge detection.

**Thoughts** Was gonna improve the API by packing everything into a nice class, but hey, fixed the detection instead and cleaned up code.

**Link(s) to work**
No links!


### Day 3: January 25th, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Refactored most mesh analysis stuff into MeshAnalyserUtils and almost finished work on a more effeicient MeshAnalyser (1 loop > 2 loops). Also accidentally introduced a bug.

**Thoughts** I gotta get this done earlier in the day, doing it just before 24 kills me. Set a timer, mute *everything*. Friends and family can wait 1 hour.

### Day 4: January 26th, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Finished refactoring and fixed existing bugs. Slowly started work on hole detection

**Thoughts** Muting everything worked, but I feel super fucking stressed with everything I have to do every day already. Let's see tomorrow...

### Day 5: January 27th, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I'm a grade a retard today and couldn't figure out how to detect holes, no progress.

**Thoughts** I hate banging my head against a wall, hope today will be better.

**Link(s) to work**
No.


### Day 6: January 28th, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Got over my retardation and figured out a super smooth way to figure out if something is a hole. Made an Edge entity class

**Thoughts** Finding the simplest solution is often a good thing, it just takes a bit of time.

**Link(s) to work**
No.


### Day 7: January 29th, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Hole finding.

**Thoughts** Don't remember.

**Link(s) to work**

### Day 9: January 31st, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I don't actually remember, writing this on day 10.

**Thoughts** None.

**Link(s) to work**
No.


### Day 10: February 2nd, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Refractored Edge class into Edge, ExtrudedEdge, and GridEdge. Added methods for extruding edges.

**Thoughts** Looking forward to testing extrusion tomorrow! Need to figure out how to connect edges, but should be pretty simple.

**Link(s) to work**
No.


### Day 11: February 4th, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Extruded edges succesfully!

**Thoughts** Missed another day but oh boy I made a lotta progress today! Extrusion works! I'll have to double check a few things, but for now I'm just stoked that it works!

### Day 12: February 5th, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Fixed an off-by-one bug

**Thoughts** Prolly gonna have to do a bit more bug-fixing and making a function for filling holes.

**Link(s) to work**
Nope!


### Day 13: February 7th, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Fixed a small scaling issue, played around with extrusion.

**Thoughts** I really needed the weekend off so it was good to just play around with the tool rather than making big changes/progress.

### Day 14: February 8th, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Corrected stuff in my pull request and finished the merge. Then started implementing heightmaps.

**Thoughts**: Heightmaps should be real easy tbh. I'm getting pretty bored at home and behind schedule with other stuff tho :(

Not today my friend!
